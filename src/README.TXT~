PROJECT TITLE: GRAPH
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Educational
VERSION or DATE: 13.09.2016
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Press "Run"
AUTHOR: Tobias Dorsch
USER INSTRUCTIONS:

- To start press "Run"
- On the bottom right there is a switch, that displays a mode which can be changed by clicking on the switch.
  Depending on the mode you can:
  + Move vertices by dragging them.
  + Add a vertex to the graph by clicking somewhere inside the upper left rectangle. NOTE: Works only if you click outside vertices and of the rectangles that bound the edges. If necessary move edges before.
  + Add an edge by clicking the two vertices that it should connect.
  + Delete an edge by clicking on it and confirming by clicking on the cross. (NOTE: Still very buggy.)
  + Perform a depth-first-search when the switch shows "Tiefensuch": first click on the start edge, then on the target edge.


The whole application is still VERY BUGGY. If necessary press "reset" and then re-"run". In particular this might be necessary after performing either of the two available search algorithms.
